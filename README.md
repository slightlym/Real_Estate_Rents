# Real_Estate_Rents
Research project within HEIG-VD on Swiss real estate rents

This repository contains code used for the project on Swiss real estate rents that I executed in HEIG-VD in 2018-2019.

Objectives of the project were following:
1. Build a predictive model for Swiss rents using only publicly available data
2. Make it easy and cheap to reproduce, restricting the number of variables used
3. Take into account causality and remove potential biases arising when it is not included. It can be done at expense of predictions precision.

The purpose of the project was to build a minimum viable model for further development with a business partner. Taking into consideration of causality was necessary because potential partners were the players of real estate market that were not just buying/selling/renting dwellings but also building them. Thus, at later stages the initial data could be enriched with partner's data on their clients and used to answer not just a question "how much this dwelling is worth" but also to help understanding what dwellings should be built in a given area in order to be rented at profit.

The project was made in R.
